=Working Title: "The Entropy/Naturalness of Software Documentation"=

==Research Questions==

We expect the cross-entropy of the the following to be in decreasing order

#English text
#Documentation
#Source code of API
#CE found in Docs

==Motivation==
If programmers writing code are repetitive and predictable, I would
bet that questions and answers (and to a lesser extent, formal
documentation) about code are even more repetitive and predictable
because people tend to ask and answer the same questions repeatedly
(ie people learn in similar ways). The entropy comparison that I
would like to see/do is not between general English and code or even
among programs, but between the (informal) documentation of an API and
the programs that use the API. Given that there is English as well as
code fragments in documentation, I would suspect that documentation
would have higher entropy than source code. However, if we use ACER to
extract the code elements and ignore the English text, I would suspect
that source code would have a higher entropy than code elements in
documentation. In effect, I hypothesize that the English between the
code elements is obscuring the repetitive and simple nature of the
topics covered by the documentation.

==For Peter==

*Find data sets and project to examine
* Get postgres converted for so
* create ACE git repo

==For next meeting==

*download latest [http://www.clearbits.net/torrents/2141-jun-2013 stackoverflow torrent]
*Make rigbypc a collaborator on your github repo call doc_entropy 
*Read references and find other papers
*Get the entropy calculators from Abram and Josh (should be in github)

==Important References==

**Look at citations of this paper on google scholar
* scam2013_submission_20

==Preliminary evidence==

Some preliminary evidence from HttpClient: Documentation covers the
same code elements in multiple documents. While the mailing list
covers the most distinct code elements, documentation in general
covers a limited set of features provided by an API.
